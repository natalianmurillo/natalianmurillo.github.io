<h1>What Algorithms Want</h1>
<p>We define who we are in the digital world because virtual spaces are becoming more real to us than visceral ones.
  This co-identity (tech+human) creates a gap between abstraction and reality. Replacing the public sphere with the
  programmable sphere (algorithmic led culture) can help us or it can hurt us.This is a critical point in human engagement: 
  an opportunity to redefine our relationship with machines. I recently finished “What Algorithms Want” by Ed Flynn. 
  The text offered a refreshing perspective onto the role algorithms play in shaping culture. 
  Although rooted in mathematics, algorithms systematically appear in other disciplines, such as philosophy and semantics. 
  Through its multidisciplinary quality, algorithms have the capability to define the gap between process and implementation 
  of “effective computability.”</p>
  
 <p>One section of the text really resonated with me: social gaming. Social gaming is using to create social experiences
    that use the power of games (i.e. players, high stakes, rewards) without being quite explicit. In quantifying the goals 
    and metrics of interaction, companies like Facebook and Linkedin have redefined social behavior. Some may even define
    these algorithms as “exploitationware.” Humans are drawn into the virtual world of a game, yet lose all the benefits 
    of in-person interaction. We pay to play through time, social status (sharing our networks), and often money (subscriptions). 
 </p>
  
 <p>Algorithms have taken hold of the way we communicate and interact. For example, machines now play a role in filtering
   friendships and moderating speech. Human consumption is closely tied to the machine. That being true, why don’t we measure
   intelligence as a “collective being” (tech+human)? We will always be incentivized to strengthen our relationship to technology 
   because as humans, we hold an innate desire for perfect knowledge of the world. Humanity expands its knowledge set at a
   significantly faster rate with the help of computational systems. The seduction of truth acts as a catalyst for the next
   generation of humanity: a co-identity between man and computer.
